# Picapica Photo Booth

## Additional Notes
## Local clone assets

This repository includes a pixel-accurate clone of the Picapica landing page under the route `/clone`.
To make the clone fully offline and exact, the project expects the photostrip image and Montserrat font files to be present under `public/assets` and `public/assets/fonts`.

I've included a small PowerShell helper to download those assets automatically:
1. From the project root run:

```powershell
.\download-assets.ps1
```

This will create:

- `public/assets/picapica-photostrip.png`
- `public/assets/fonts/Montserrat-Regular.ttf`
- `public/assets/fonts/Montserrat-Bold.ttf`

The clone component prefers the local assets at runtime and will fall back to the original remote URLs if the local files are missing.

License / provenance: you confirmed you have permission to use these assets. Keep any required attributions in the UI (the footer credits the original author).
# Picapica Photo Booth

A ReactJS replica of the Picapica Photo Booth website - a web-based photo booth that captures 4 photos and creates custom photo strips with filters and frames.
